The often-unsung heroes of the animation medium - Impact Frames - are something I’ve always taken an interest in. And to better my understanding of them while involving my other interest – programming, I decided to try my hand at auto generating impact frames programmatically, as well as automatically finding the best locations to insert them in any provided clip (and I mean ANY kind of clip). 

Using Python and OpenCV for image processing, motion detection and managing of videos, I embark on a brand new adventure, trying to unravel the mysteries of such an underrated technique, trying to shine light upon it - with a classic twist, of course.
